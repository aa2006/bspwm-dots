# My bspwm dotfiles

(I know my vim config is kinda bloated but I like it that way :/)

## Contains:
- bspwm config
- sxhkd config
- polybar config
- picom config
- qutebrowser config
- dunst config

### Note:
Requires you to have a Nerd Font installed (I use Fira Code)

(This is a pywal config so everything is theme-able using pywal)

## Screenshots:
(I'm a bit lazy imma add them later)
